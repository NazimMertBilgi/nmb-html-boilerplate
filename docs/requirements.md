### Installation Steps

1. **Download Node.js**: Visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer for your operating system.

2. **Run the Installer**: Open the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

3. **Verify Installation**:
    - Open a terminal or command prompt.
    - Run the following commands to check if Node.js and npm are installed correctly:
      ```sh
      node -v
      npm -v
      ```
    - You should see the version numbers of Node.js and npm.

4. **Update npm (Optional)**: You can update npm to the latest version by running:
    ```sh
    npm install -g npm
    ```

Now you are ready to use Node.js and npm for your project.
